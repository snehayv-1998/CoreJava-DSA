     https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/
     Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.
     Example 1:
     Input: nums = [3,0,1]
     Output: 2
     Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

    /*
    https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-numbers-disappeared-in-an-array/
    Given an integer array nums of length n where all the integers of nums are in the range [1, n] and each integer appears once or twice, return an array of all the integers that appears twice.
    You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses only constant extra space.
    Example 1:
    Input: nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
    Output: [2,3]
